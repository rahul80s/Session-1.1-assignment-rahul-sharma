1) True or False:
a) Prescriptive analytics used to predict the future outcomes? 
False
1) True or False:
b) Base R packages installed automatically? 
False as we have to select and install it each package manually and then it will download automatically.

2) What is recycling of elements in a vector?  It is when to apply an operation to two vectors which requires them to 
be of the same number of lengths and R automatically recycles until 
it is matched with the longer vector. 

3) Give an example of recycling of elements.  If we have 2 vectors a(1,2,3) , a(1,2,3,4), in this case, the first 
one is shorter with only 3 elements and the second one is longer 
with 4 elements only, so if need to add up, then we will not get the desired 
results.
